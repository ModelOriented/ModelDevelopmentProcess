Description: This package generates profile plots for Model Development Process. 
  MDP is a general framework in which one can describe which phases and steps 
  need more effort while building a predictive model. 
  Specific use-cases are different in terms of workload and focus. 
  MDP package helps to define these specific profiles and compare them visually.
  The MDP methodology is available at CC BY license and ML researchers are invited to propose their definitions of process profiles. See examples in the inst/processes folder.
  You will find a more detailed description of the Model Development Process at <arXiv:1907.04461>.
